Website layout based on fullscreen sections which can be slide by:
- URL,
- scroll wheel,
- mouse swipe,
- touch swipe,
- keyboard buttons,
- UI arrows,
- anchor links.

I used pure JavaScript without any framework or library.

Interesting part of code:
- custom JavaScript events,
- animation based on requestAnimationFrame function,
- basic JSDoc documentation,
- dynamic menu.

Previous Git history won't be published.

Any feedback is welcome.
